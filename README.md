## Canada Crime Data Dashboard

## Overview of Project
From all Canada&apos;s crime reports that have occurred in different provinces every year my Crime Data Dashboard gives an insight on the Top 5 crimes that has occurred in Canada during the year 2008 to 2012 which are most likely to impact the inhabitants in Canada.

Here I have developed a visualization system using data from Ontario&apos;s Data Catalogue.

## User experience (UX) design
The following features have been added to make the user experience interactive
- The Crime Data Dashboard is a single page application with a fixed top nav bar. 
- It provides &quot;at a glance&quot; results for policing topic areas and allows users to click through each area to learn more through visualizations.
- It is possible to navigate through the site using mouse or arrow keys. 
- The site provides graphs of various kinds of graphs which include Row Charts, Pie Charts, Bar charts , Number display and Select menu for refining search, thus  giving a visualized information about the crime rate for years 2008- 2012  in Canada.
- This charts are interactive in a way that it can be filtered based on any requirements of the client just on a click
- The web page also provide a Reset button to clear any filters applied to the webpage as well a scrolling Top button on the right which shows once the user scrolls down the page.


#### User Stories
The various users of this Dash Board would be

As any one of the users, he/she would be interested in finding information about the following

- Total crimes reported per 100,000 inhabitants for each year or collectively.
- From all the crimes reported which crime has the highest record reported.
- Total crime in each province of Canada.
