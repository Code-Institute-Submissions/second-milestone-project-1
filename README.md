## Canada Crime Data Dashboard

## Overview of Project
From all Canada&apos;s crime reports that have occurred in different provinces every year my Crime Data Dashboard gives an insight on the Top 5 crimes that has occurred in Canada during the year 2008 to 2012 which are most likely to impact the inhabitants in Canada.

Here I have developed a visualization system using data from Ontario&apos;s Data Catalogue.

## User experience (UX) design
The following features have been added to make the user experience interactive

- This charts are interactive in a way that it can be filtered based on any requirements of the client just on a click
- The web page also provide a Reset button to clear any filters applied to the webpage as well a scrolling Top button on the right which shows once the user scrolls down the page.
