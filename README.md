## Canada Crime Data Dashboard

##Overview of Project
From all Canada&apos;s crime reports that have occurred in different provinces every year my Crime Data Dashboard gives an insight on the Top 5 crimes that has occurred in Canada during the year 2008 to 2012 which are most likely to impact the inhabitants in Canada.

Here I have developed a visualization system using data from Ontario&apos;s Data Catalogue.
